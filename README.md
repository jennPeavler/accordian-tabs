# Pattern Party

This repo contains three html/css techniques:  Accordion Tabs, Flex Cards, and Header Bar.

## Accordion Tabs

There are four sections with clickable tabs.  Each tab has an event listener attached to it.  When the tab is clicked, the section associated with the tab is shown, while the other tabs remain hidden.  The sections use relative left margins in order to be shown in the same relative position to one another.

##  Flex Cards

There is a grid of cards.  The cards are two sizes at desktop width and will be responsive to the size of the screen.  At mobile layout, all cards are a uniform width.

##  Header Bar

This is a clickable header bar that drops down a navigation menu at mobile width.  At desktop width, the navigation is already shown and clickable.
